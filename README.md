"Social Media Analytics"

In this Project we have solved following problems:

1. Calculate the total number of actions performed by each user.
2. Determine the most common action performed by users.
3. Identify the user who has the highest engagement (sum of all actions).
4. Provide statistics on user activity over time (e.g., daily).
